# Core Algorithms #

These are some fairly basic and fundamental computer science
algorithms that I wanted to implement myself to make sure I understood
them properly.  They mostly stem from ([Algorithms
Illuminated](https://www.algorithmsilluminated.org), a series of books
I am reading from cover to cover to brush up on my CS fundamentals.

I am a physicist by training and whilst I have picked these things up
here and there over the years, I wanted to revisit them in a more
formal and cohesive form to be more certain I've not missed anything.
